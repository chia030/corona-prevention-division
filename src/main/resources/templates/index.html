                    A PCR test shows if you currently have COVID-19. The virus test is performed by taking a throat swab
                    (sample) from your throat. When you book an appointment for a test here, you book an appointment for
                    a PCR test.

                    With the vaccines currently approved in Denmark, you must be vaccinated twice within the space of a
                    few weeks to achieve the full effect of the vaccination. You must therefore book times for both
                    injections.

            <h2>Are vaccines safe?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Once vaccines are demonstrated to be safe and efficacious, they must be authorized by national
                regulators, manufactured to exacting standards, and distributed. WHO is working with partners around the
                world to help coordinate key steps in this process, including to facilitate equitable access to safe and
                effective COVID-19 vaccines for the billions of people who will need them. More information about
                COVID-19 vaccine development is available here.</p>

            <h2>What are the benefits of getting vaccinated?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The COVID-19 vaccines produce protection against the disease, as a result of developing an immune
                response to the SARS-Cov-2 virus. Developing immunity through vaccination means there is a reduced risk
                of developing the illness and its consequences. This immunity helps you fight the virus if exposed.
                Getting vaccinated may also protect people around you, because if you are protected from getting
                infected and from disease, you are less likely to infect someone else. This is particularly important to
                protect people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, such as healthcare providers, older
                or elderly adults, and people with other medical conditions.</p>
